**Advantages of TestNG over JUnit:**

**a. Parallel Test Execution**:

TestNG allows parallel execution of test cases, which significantly reduces the overall test execution time, making it faster and more efficient.

**b. Flexible Test Configuration:**

TestNG provides flexible configuration through XML files, enabling users to define various parameters for test suites, including test dependencies, parallel execution settings, and data provider configurations.

**c. Test Prioritization:**

TestNG allows you to set priorities for test methods, ensuring critical tests are executed first and less critical ones later.

**d. Grouping of Test Methods:**

You can categorize test methods into groups in TestNG, allowing for better organization and selection of tests to run.

**e. Data Parameterization:**

TestNG provides the ability to pass parameters to test methods, making it easier to execute the same test with different sets of data.

**f. Built-in Reporting:**

TestNG generates detailed HTML reports by default, offering clear insights into test execution results.
