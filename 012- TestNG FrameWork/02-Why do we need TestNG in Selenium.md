## Why Do We Need TestNG in Selenium? ##

TestNG is particularly useful in Selenium automation testing for the following reasons:

---

**Parallel Execution:** 

Selenium tests can be executed in parallel on different browsers and platforms concurrently, maximizing efficiency.

**Grouping and Prioritizing:** 

TestNG allows organizing tests into logical groups and setting priorities, aiding in selective test execution and prioritization.

**Data Parameterization:** 

With TestNG, you can easily provide different sets of data to your tests, improving test coverage.

**Dependency Management:** 

TestNG ensures the orderly execution of tests by specifying dependencies between test methods or groups.

**Reporting:** 

TestNG generates detailed and intuitive HTML reports, simplifying result analysis.
