## Automation Testing: ##

Automation testing is the process of utilizing automated tools and scripts to execute predefined test cases on software applications. It involves automating the repetitive and manual steps involved in testing to enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and coverage. The primary goal is to validate that the software functions as expected and meets specified requirements.

Automated testing tools can simulate user interactions, perform data comparisons, and assess system behaviour based on predefined criteria. These tools generate detailed reports and identify defects or inconsistencies in the application, allowing for quicker and more reliable feedback to the development team.

## Real time example: ##

Imagine Shop Ease, an e-commerce platform, wants to automate the process of adding items to the shopping cart and ensuring the checkout process works flawlessly. Automation testing here would involve using tools like Selenium to create scripts that simulate a user adding items to the cart, proceeding to checkout, entering payment details, and completing the purchase.
