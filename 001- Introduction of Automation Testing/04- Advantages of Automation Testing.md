**Broader Test Coverage:** 

Automation allows for a more extensive range of test scenarios to be executed during a testing cycle.

**Cost-Efficiency:** 

Over the long term, automation reduces testing costs by decreasing the time and effort required for testing activities.

**Early Bug Detection:** 

Automated tests catch bugs early in the development cycle, reducing the cost of fixing issues in later stages.

**Real time examples:**
