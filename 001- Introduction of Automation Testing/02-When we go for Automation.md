**Automation testing is appropriate in the following scenarios:**

**Repetitive Testing**:

` `When there are repetitive test cases that need to be executed frequently, automation saves time and effort.

**Regression Testing**:

` `For ensuring that new code changes don't adversely affect existing functionality, automation is essential to retest the entire application.

**Performance Testing:** 

Automating performance tests to simulate a large number of users and evaluate system response and stability under load.

**Complex and Time-Consuming Scenarios**: 

For scenarios that are complex, time-consuming, or difficult to perform manually, automation can provide a systematic approach.

**Cross-platform Testing**: 

When the application needs to be tested across different devices, browsers, or operating systems, automation ensures consistency and efficiency.

**Real time example:**

In Shop Ease, automation would be necessary:

**Repetitive Testing:** 

Running daily tests to ensure the 'add to cart' and 'checkout' processes work every time a new feature is added or modified.

**Regression Testing:** 

After implementing updates to the website, automated tests would verify that existing functionalities like adding items to the cart still work as expected**.**
