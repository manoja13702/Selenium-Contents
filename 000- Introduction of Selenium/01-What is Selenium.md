## Selenium: ##

Selenium is an open-source and a portable automated software testing tool for testing web -applications. It has capabilities to operate across different browsers and operating systems. Selenium is not just a single tool but a set of tools that helps testers to automate web-based applications more efficiently.

**For example:**

Imagine a software tester wanting to automate the process of logging into a web application, filling out a form and verifying the submitted data. Selenium provides the tools and libraries needed to automate these actions, making the testing process efficient and repeatable.
