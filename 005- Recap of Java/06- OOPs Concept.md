**OOPs Concepts:**

**Classes and Objects:** 

Classes are blueprints for objects, defining their properties and behaviour.

**Inheritance:** 

Allows a class to use properties and behaviour of another class. Encourages reusability and extensibility.

**Polymorphism:** 

Allows methods to do different things based on the object they are acting upon, achieved through method overloading and method overriding.

**Encapsulation:** 

Wrapping the data (fields) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.

**Abstraction:** 

Representing the essential features without including the background details.

**Example (class definition, inheritance, polymorphism):**

**c**lass Vehicle {

`    `void drive() {

`        `System.out.println("Driving...");

`    `}

}

class Car extends Vehicle {

`    `@Override

`    `void drive() {

`        `System.out.println("Driving a car...");

`    `}

`    `void accelerate() {

`        `System.out.println("Accelerating...");

`    `}

}

public class Main {

`    `public static void main(String[] args) {

`        `Car myCar = new Car();

`        `myCar.drive(); // Polymorphism

`        `myCar.accelerate(); // Accessing subclass method

`    `}

}
