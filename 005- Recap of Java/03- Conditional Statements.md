**Conditional Statements:**

- Conditional statements allow the program to execute different code based on certain conditions. 
- Key constructs include:

**if-else:** Conditional branching based on a true or false condition.

**switch-case:** Multiple branches based on the value of an expression.

**Example (if-else):**

int age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {

`    `System.out.println("You are an adult.");

} else {

`    `System.out.println("You are a minor.");

}
