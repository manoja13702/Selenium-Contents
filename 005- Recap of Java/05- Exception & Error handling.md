**Exception and Error Handling:**

Java provides a robust exception handling mechanism to deal with errors during runtime. Exceptions are objects that represent errors. The main keywords are try, catch, throw, throws, and finally.

**Example:**

try {

`    `int result = 10 / 0; // This will cause an ArithmeticException

} catch (ArithmeticException e) {

`    `System.out.println("An arithmetic error occurred: " + e.getMessage());

}
