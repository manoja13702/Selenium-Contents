## Loop Statements, Array: ##

**Loop Statements**: 

Loops allow executing a block of code repeatedly. Common types are for, while, and do-while loops.

**Example (for loop):**
~~~
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {

System.out.println("Iteration " + i);

}
~~~
**Array:** 

Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type. They have a fixed size.

**Example (declaring and initializing an array):**
~~~
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
~~~
