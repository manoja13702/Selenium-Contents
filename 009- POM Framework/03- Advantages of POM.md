## Advantages of POM: ##

**Reusability:** 

Page classes can be reused in multiple tests, saving development time and effort.

**Maintainability:** 

Changes in the UI can be localized to specific page classes, making maintenance easier and reducing the risk of breaking other parts of the code.

**Readability:** 

Test cases become more readable and understandable as page-specific logic is abstracted into separate page classes.

**Reduced Code Duplication:** 

Common interactions with elements are encapsulated within the page classes, reducing code duplication.
